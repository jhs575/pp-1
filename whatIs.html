                <p class="mb-7 lg:text-lg">
                    Over the last few years, many car enthusiasts have started turning their attention to recent
                    vehicles - cars from the 1980s, 1990s, and beyond. Automotive reviewer <a class="text-red-700"
                        href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">Doug DeMuro</a> realized there isn't yet a
                    specific place that's focused solely on buying and selling these modern enthusiast cars, but there
                    should be - so he and a team created Cars & Bids, with its simple name modeled after Doug's famous
                    pursuit of “quirks and features.”
                </p>
                <p class="mb-7 lg:text-lg">
                    Cars & Bids is the best online auction marketplace to buy and sell modern enthusiast cars - and that
                    means pretty much anything that's cool from the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s, or 2020s. To us, “cool”
                    ranges from the obvious (a Ferrari F355 or a Lamborghini Gallardo) to the esoteric (a pristine Dodge
                    Dakota Convertible or a Mercury Capri XR2) to the traditional fun cars that enthusiasts love (a
                    Mazda MX-5 Miata or a Porsche 911). Basically everything that's exciting, fun, interesting, or
                    quirky is welcome here - as long as it comes from the modern era.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-7 lg:text-lg">
                    Although there are many places to buy and sell a special car, Cars &amp; Bids offers significant
                    advantages over other websites.
                    <strong>Here are just a few of our benefits:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul class="ms-4 my-8 lg:text-lg">
                    <li class="list-disc mt-5 ps-2 lg:ps-5 lg:mt-8 "><strong>We're focused on modern enthusiast cars:</strong> the 1980s
                        to the 2020s. That means anyone interested in the next era of exciting cars will come here first
                        to buy and sell.</li>
                    <li class="list-disc mt-5 ps-2 lg:ps-5 lg:mt-8 "><strong>Our fees are low.</strong> Sellers list for free, and the
                        buyer's fee is just 4.5%, with a minimum of $225 and a maximum of $4,500 — far below other
                        auction houses and enthusiast car auction websites.</li>
                    <li class="list-disc mt-5 ps-2 lg:ps-5 lg:mt-8 "><strong>We believe that every vehicle should come with a vehicle
                            history report</strong> - so we provide one, for free, instead of asking sellers to pay for
                        their own.</li>
                    <li class="list-disc mt-5 ps-2 lg:ps-5 lg:mt-8 "><strong>Doug DeMuro will bring extra eyes - and extra buyers - to
                            your cars,</strong> periodically reviewing cars offered on Cars &amp; Bids. If your car is
                        chosen, you'll get far more eyes on your vehicle than any other auction platform on earth.</li>
                    <li class="list-disc mt-5 ps-2 lg:ps-5 lg:mt-8 ">While other car auctions take weeks or even months to get your car
                        listed and available to buyers, <strong>we'll get your car listed quickly</strong> - and we'll
                        even take your input on scheduling your car's auction. </li>
                    <li class="list-disc mt-5 ps-2 lg:ps-5 lg:mt-8 "><strong>Cars &amp; Bids makes it easy to submit your car for
                            sale.</strong> We value your time by asking for only a few crucial details before letting
                        you know whether or not we're accepting your vehicle. That means you don't have to waste your
                        time providing initial information only to have your car rejected.</li>
                    <li class="list-disc mt-5 ps-2 lg:ps-5 lg:mt-8 "><strong>Cars &amp; Bids is the most user-friendly online automotive
                            marketplace,</strong> with easy sorting and searching - and simplified auctions that tell
                        you exactly what you need to know about each vehicle.</li>
                    <li class="list-disc mt-5 ps-2 lg:ps-5 lg:mt-8 ">We're always here to help - <strong>including after the auction
                            ends</strong>. We've built a step-by-step checklist to ensure a smooth sale - and we're just
                        a chat away if you have any questions.</li>

                    1. Register to RHD

                </h4>
                <p class="mb-7 lg:text-lg">While we've tried to make buying a car online as safe and easy as possible, it's
                    ultimately your responsibility to perform your own due diligence and make sure that the car you're
                    considering is right for you<strong>- prior to placing a RHD</strong></p>

                <p class="mb-7 lg:text-lg">To ensure a smooth transaction, you should have the following organized prior to placing
                    a RHD.</p>

                    <li class="list-disc mt-5 ps-2">To facilitate your purchase, we've teamed up with LightStream to
                        make financing easy and fast for users with good to excellent credit. You can check out rates
                        and payments - and apply for a loan - directly from each auction! LightStream financing is not
                        tied to a specific vehicle, and you can get your loan funded - and money deposited into your
                        account - as soon as the same day you apply.**</li>
                    <li class="list-disc mt-5 ps-2">As a reminder, if you plan to finance this purchase, work with your
                        lender to get your financing approved ahead of time - and keep in mind that some lenders may
                        require specific vehicle information and may have year and mileage restrictions.</li>
                    <li class="list-disc mt-5 ps-2">Discuss transportation and storage timelines (if applicable) with
                        the seller, and if you'll be shipping the vehicle, get a quick and easy shipping quote directly

                        fee - if you win, your card will be charged and you will pay the seller directly for the
                        vehicle, otherwise, the hold will be released at the auction's end.</li>
                    <li class="list-disc mt-5 ps-2">Bids are binding, so only bid if you fully intend to purchase the
                        car and you have performed the requisite due diligence, because you might end up as the high
                        bidder and there are no refunds.</li>
                    <li class="list-disc mt-5 ps-2">To ensure the bidding process is fair for everyone, bids placed
                        within the final minute of the auction will reset the auction's time remaining back to 1 minute
                        - giving others the opportunity to bid.</li>

                <p class="mb-7 lg:text-lg">
                    To buy a car on Cars & Bids, you must win the auction by ultimately being the highest bidder - and,
                    if the auction has a “Reserve,” by placing a bid that meets or exceeds the seller's hidden “Reserve”
                    price. If the auction has “No Reserve,” then the highest bidder wins it regardless of the amount
                    they bid.

                <p class="mb-7 lg:text-lg">
                    After the auction closes, we'll provide you with a step-by-step checklist to complete your purchase.
                    You'll also receive the seller's contact information (and vice-versa) in order to finalize the
                    details and logistics of the transaction. <strong>Buyers are expected to pay for the vehicle in-full

                    It's free to <a class="text-red-700" title="Submit your car" href="#">submit your car</a>. We simply
                    ask you for a few details - including the VIN, some photos, and a brief description of the car. You
                    can also choose whether you want to set a reserve price, or if you want your vehicle to be sold with
                    no reserve. A reserve price is a minimum value you'll accept in order to sell your car - and while a
                    reserve auction may seem like an appealing choice, we've found that vehicles offered with no reserve
                    get more bids, more interest, and more attention.

                <p class="mb-7 lg:text-lg">
                    If you choose a reserve auction, we'll ask you to suggest a reserve price - but, based on market
                    conditions, we may ask for a lower one before accepting your car. Keep in mind that all of our
                    auctions start from $0, regardless of whether or not they have a reserve.

The vehicle and title should only be released once the seller has the full payment in hand.

                            Inspectors will test drive the vehicle as long as it is street-legal, safe to drive, and the
                            seller allows them to drive it. In some instances, an inspector may not be able to test
                            drive a vehicle, due to size constraints or liability issues. The vehicle may be test driven
                            by the seller or seller's representative in these instances.
